# Powerpoint templates for figures
This repository contains two powerpoint files for single and double column figures, according to _Nature_'s guidance. Their [formatting guide](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide) writes
> Figures should not contain more than one panel unless the parts are logically connected; each panel of a multipart figure should be sized so that the whole figure can be reduced by the same amount and reproduced on the printed page at the smallest size at which essential details are visible. For guidance, **Natureâ€™s standard figure sizes are 90 mm (single column) and 180 mm (double column) and the full depth of the page is 170 mm**.

The two remplates in this repository are:
- [template-single-column.pptx](template-single-column.pptx), 90 mm x 85 mm (half page depth)
- [template-double-column.pptx](template-single-column.pptx), 180 mm x 85 mm (half page depth)
